# Ansible repository to (finally) provision my private laptop. 

I usually develop a lot of projects, that also need to be
maintained occasionally. This requires maintaining couple 
of different versions of Python interpreter, couple of 
versions of ``ansible``, ``docker compose`` and so on. 

So idea is to have a tool that will set up all this stuff with 
a simple command. 

This is a work in progress that I intend to do in spare time. 

DONE: 

1. Installation of pythons. 
2. Installation of gcloud tools

8. Installation of python venvs.
